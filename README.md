\## Description



This project demonstrates the end-to-end methodology of building, evaluating, and interpreting an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast the daily price of a major stock market index (e.g., the S\&P 500 - `^GSPC`).



The notebook walks through the key steps of statistical time series forecasting, including:

1\.  \*\*Stationarity Testing:\*\* Using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check if the time series is stationary.

2\.  \*\*Data Transformation:\*\* Applying log returns to transform the non-stationary price series into a stationary one.

3\.  \*\*Model Identification:\*\* Interpreting Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots to identify potential model parameters.

4\.  \*\*Model Fitting and Selection:\*\* Iterating through several ARIMA models to find the best fit based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

5\.  \*\*Forecasting \& Interpretation:\*\* Generating a price forecast and critically analyzing its performance against actual market data.



\## Key Insight \& Conclusion



This exercise serves as a powerful demonstration of both the capabilities and limitations of using a simple ARIMA model for long-range financial forecasting.



\* \*\*Capability:\*\* The model successfully identifies the small, positive long-term drift in the historical data, resulting in a forecast that predicts a smooth, steady increase.

\* \*\*Limitation:\*\* The model is inherently backward-looking and completely fails to capture real-world volatility and major market turning points (e.g., the 2022 downturn). The straight-line forecast highlights that ARIMA, on its own, is not suited for predicting complex, dynamic price paths over extended periods.



This result is not an error but an accurate reflection of the model's constraints, emphasizing the need for more complex models (like GARCH for volatility or machine learning models with external features) for more sophisticated market prediction.



\## Technologies \& Libraries Used



\* \*\*Python 3.x\*\*

\* \*\*Jupyter Notebook\*\*

\* \*\*`yfinance`\*\*: For fetching historical stock data.

\* \*\*`pandas`\*\* \& \*\*`numpy`\*\*: For data manipulation and transformation.

\* \*\*`matplotlib`\*\*: For plotting the data.

\* \*\*`statsmodels`\*\*: For the ADF test, ACF/PACF plots, and ARIMA model implementation.

\* \*\*`scikit-learn`\*\*: For splitting data into training and testing sets.



\## How to Run This Project



1\.  \*\*Prerequisites:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

&nbsp;   \* Using a virtual environment is recommended.



2\.  \*\*Install Libraries:\*\*

&nbsp;   Open your terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries:

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn jupyterlab

&nbsp;   ```



3\.  \*\*Launch Jupyter:\*\*

&nbsp;   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and launch Jupyter.



4\.  \*\*Open and Run the Notebook:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Open the `.ipynb` project file.

&nbsp;   \* The script will prompt you to enter a stock ticker (e.g., `^GSPC`) and a start/end date for the analysis.

&nbsp;   \* Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis and generate the plots and forecast.
